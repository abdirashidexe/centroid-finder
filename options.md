Option 1: JCodec
Pros:
1. Pure Java, isn't an external program. We simply add via Maven and start working immediately.
2. Easily get individual frames from a video as BufferedImage objects (other libraries are hheavier and setup-intensive)

Cons:
1. There's no built=in audio processing, complex filters, or effects
2. Metadata has basic info only - this means it doesn't give detailed codec settings
