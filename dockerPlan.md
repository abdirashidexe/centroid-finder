Plan for making our docker image. (can optionally include a picture or diagram)
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Things to consider (can fill out):

1. What base docker image will you use? (Do research online and with AIs!)

2. How will you make sure that both node and Java can run in your image?

3. How will you test your Dockerfile and image?

4. How will you make sure the endpoints are available outside the image?

5. How will your code know where to access the video/results directory? Hint: environment variables and volumes. (We'll talk about volumes on Thursday)

6. How can you make you docker image small, cacheable, and quick to make changes to?
