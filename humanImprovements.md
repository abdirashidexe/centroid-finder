# Refactoring code
What improvements can you make to the design/architecture of your code?
- Having the csv files be outputted in one folder rather than having them be created and dumped in the target folder

How can you split up large methods or classes into smaller components?
- 

Are there unused files/methods that can be removed?
- Deleting and finding out why it keeps duplicating package.json, as well as the input and output samples

Where would additional Java interfaces be appropriate?
- 

How can you make things simpler, more-usable, and easier to maintain?
- Creating a controller in our server to handle some of the logic in the server splitting up some things in the route

# adding tests
What portions of your code are untested / only lightly tested?
- 

Where would be the highest priority places to add new tests?
- 

Other testing improvements?
- 

# improving error handling
What parts of your code are brittle?
- 

Where could you better be using exceptions?
- 

Where can you better add input validation to check invalid input?
- 

How can you better be resolving/logging/surfacing errors? Hint: almost any place you're using "throws Exception" or "catch(Exception e)"should likely be improved to specify the specific types of exceptions that might be thrown or caught.
